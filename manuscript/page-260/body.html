Dick’s bed was empty — only after a minute did she realize that she had been awakened by a knock at their salon door.</p><p>“Entrez!” she called, but there was no answer, and after a moment she slipped on a dressing-gown and went to open it. A sergent-de- ville confronted her courteously and stepped inside the door.</p><p>“Mr. Afghan North — he is here?”</p><p>“What? No — he’s gone to America.”</p><p>“When did he leave, Madame?”</p><p>“Yesterday morning.”</p><p>He shook his head and waved his forefinger at her in a quicker rhythm.</p><p>“He was in Paris last night. He is registered here but his room is not occupied. They told me I had better ask at this room.”</p></div> </div>
