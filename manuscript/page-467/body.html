The sparkle of the mica was dulled by the baked ground, and a few gusts of mistral from down the coast seeped through the Esterel and rocked the fishing boats in the harbor, pointing the masts here and there at a featureless sky.</p><p>"I had a letter this morning," said Mrs. Speers. "What a terrible time you all must have had with those Negroes! But Rosemary said you were perfectly wonderful to her."</p><p>"Rosemary ought to have a service stripe. It was pretty harrowing-- the only person it didn't disturb was Abe North--he flew off to Havre--he probably doesn't know about it yet."</p></div> </div>
