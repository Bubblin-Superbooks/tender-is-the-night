Is this too much to ask?</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>BETH EVAN WARREN.</p><p>Dick was furious--Miss Warren had known he had a bicycle with him; yet she had so phrased her note that it was impossible to refuse. Throw us together! Sweet propinquity and the Warren money!</p><p>He was wrong; Baby Warren had no such intentions. She had looked Dick over with worldly eyes, she had measured him with the warped rule of an Anglophile and found him wanting--in spite of the fact that she found him toothsome. But for her he was too "intellectual" and she pigeonholed him with a shabby-snobby crowd she had once known in London--he put himself out too much to be really of the correct stuff. She could not see how he could be made into her idea of an aristocrat.</p></div> </div>
