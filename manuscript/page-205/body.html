Last winter she had thought him attractive--once they held hands in an automobile going from New Haven to New York; now he no longer existed for her.</p><p>In the projection room she sat between Collis Clay and Dick while the mechanic mounted the reels of Daddy's Girl and a French executive fluttered about her trying to talk American slang.
