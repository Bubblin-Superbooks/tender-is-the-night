<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Lying back in his place between Earl Brady, to whom he had addressed several withering remarks about the movies, and Mrs. Abrams, to whom he said nothing, he stared at Dick Diver with an expression of devastating irony, the effect being occasionally interrupted by his attempts to engage Dick in a cater-cornered conversation across the table.</p><p>"Aren't you a friend of Van Buren Denby?" he would say.</p><p>"I don't believe I know him."</p><p>"I thought you were a friend of his," he persisted irritably.</p><p>When the subject of Mr. Denby fell of its own weight, he essayed other equally irrelative themes, but each time the very deference of Dick's attention seemed to paralyze him, and after a moment's stark pause the conversation that he had interrupted would go on without him.</p></div> </div>
