<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>How do you do, lawyer. We're going to Como tomorrow for a week and then back to Zurich. That's why I wanted you and sister to settle this, because it doesn't matter to us how much I'm allowed. We're going to live very quietly in Zurich for two years and Dick has enough to take care of us. No, Baby, I'm more practical than you think--It's only for clothes and things I'll need it. . . . Why, that's more than--can the estate really afford to give me all that? I know I'll never manage to spend it. Do you have that much? Why do you have more--is it because I'm supposed to be incompetent? All right, let my share pile up then. . . . No, Dick refuses to have anything whatever to do with it. I'll have to feel bloated for us both. . . . Baby, you have no more idea of what Dick is like than, than--Now where do I sign? Oh, I'm sorry.</p></div> </div>
