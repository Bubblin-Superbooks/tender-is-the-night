The vague personality who corresponded to this statement was eventually hung on to the phone; in the sequence he failed to appeal to Dick, as a psychologist, or indeed as anything else. Abe's conversation flowed on as follows:</p><p>"Hello."</p><p>"Well?"</p><p>"Well, hello."</p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p>"Well."
