<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rosemary opened her door full of emotions no one else knew of. She was now what is sometimes called a "little wild thing"--by twenty- four full hours she was not yet unified and she was absorbed in playing around with chaos; as if her destiny were a picture puzzle-- counting benefits, counting hopes, telling off Dick, Nicole, her mother, the director she met yesterday, like stops on a string of beads.</p><p>When Dick knocked she had just dressed and been watching the rain, thinking of some poem, and of full gutters in Beverly Hills. When she opened the door she saw him as something fixed and Godlike as he had always been, as older people are to younger, rigid and unmalleable. Dick saw her with an inevitable sense of disappointment. It took him a moment to respond to the unguarded sweetness of her smile, her body calculated to a millimeter to suggest a bud yet guarantee a flower. He was conscious of the print of her wet foot on a rug through the bathroom door.</p></div> </div>
