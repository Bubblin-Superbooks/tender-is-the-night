"You should stay for June and then leave in July when it gets really too hot."</p><p>"You're going where?" Dick asked Nicole.</p><p>"Somewhere with my sister--somewhere exciting, I hope, because I've lost so much time. But perhaps they'll think I ought to go to a quiet place at first--perhaps Como. Why don't you come to Como?"</p><p>"Ah, Como--" began the Se�ora.</p><p>Within the building a trio broke into Suppe's "Light Cavalry." Nicole took advantage of this to stand up and the impression of her youth and beauty grew on Dick until it welled up inside him in a compact paroxysm of emotion. She smiled, a moving childish smile that was like all the lost youth in the world.</p></div> </div>
