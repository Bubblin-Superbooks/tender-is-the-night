"At least Baby and I and the governess economized and Mother travelled."</p><p>"We were economizing too," said Rosemary, realizing that the word meant different things to them.</p><p>"Mother always spoke of it very carefully as a small hotel--" Nicole gave her quick magnetic little laugh, "--I mean instead of saying a 'cheap' hotel.

As if all the big ones were too noisy and vulgar for us. Of course the friends always saw through us and told everyone about it, but Mother always said it showed we knew our way around Europe. She did, of course: she was born a German citizen. But her mother was American, and she was brought up in Chicago, and she was more American than European."</p></div> </div>
