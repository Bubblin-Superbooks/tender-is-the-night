Nicole called to the driver; even as she spoke she saw him slide under water and she gave a little cry; but he came up again and turned on his back, and "Chï¿½teau" swam near to help. It seemed forever till the boat reached them but when they came alongside at last and Nicole saw Dick floating exhausted and expressionless, alone with the water and the sky, her panic changed suddenly to contempt.</p><p>"We'll help you up, Doctor. . . . Get his foot . . . all right . . . now altogether. . . ."</p><p>Dick sat panting and looking at nothing.</p><p>"I knew you shouldn't have tried it," Nicole could not help saying.</p></div> </div>
