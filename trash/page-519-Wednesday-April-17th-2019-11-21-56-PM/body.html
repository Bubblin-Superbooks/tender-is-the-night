He was a handsome, promising boy and Dick devoted much time to him, in the relationship of a sympathetic but exacting officer and respectful enlisted man.</p><p>"Why," Lanier asked, "do you always leave a little lather on the top of your hair when you shave?"</p><p>Cautiously Dick parted soapy lips: "I have never been able to find out. I've often wondered. I think it's because I get the first finger soapy when I make the line of my side-burn, but how it gets up on top of my head I don't know."</p></div> </div>
