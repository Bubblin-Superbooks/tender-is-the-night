<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>XVII</p><p>Tommy Barban was a ruler, Tommy was a hero--Dick happened upon him in the Marienplatz in Munich, in one of those caf�s, where small gamblers diced on "tapestry" mats. The air was full of politics, and the slap of cards.</p><p>Tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh: "Um-buh--ha-ha! Um-buh--ha-ha!" As a rule, he drank little; courage was his game and his companions were always a little afraid of him. Recently an eighth of the area of his skull had been removed by a Warsaw surgeon and was knitting under his hair, and the weakest person in the caf� could have killed him with a flip of a knotted napkin.</p></div> </div>
