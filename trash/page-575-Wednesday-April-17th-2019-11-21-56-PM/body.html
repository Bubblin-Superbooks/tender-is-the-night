He remembered once when the grass was damp and she came to him on hurried feet, her thin slippers drenched with dew.

Somewhere inside me there'll always be the person I am to-night."</p><p>But Dick had come away for his soul's sake, and he began thinking about that. He had lost himself--he could not tell the hour when, or the day or the week, the month or the year.</p></div> </div>
